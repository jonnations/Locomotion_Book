Investigation into the morphological signature of arboreality in (small) mammals

#### Goals:  

1) Determine which postcranial measurements, or which form of the measurements, are the best predictors of climbing.
2) Explore the relationship between the method of categorizing locomotion and the preferred morphological measurements. 
3) Untangle the interaction of bodysize and phenotype on the prediciton of locomotor behavior.
